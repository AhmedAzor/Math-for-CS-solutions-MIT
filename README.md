> ***It soon became clear that the unconscious instincts for logic and language which had enabled me to succeed were not shared by the large majority of my students.*** - Susanna Epp (author of [Discrete Mathematics with Applications, 5th edition](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Susanna-Epp-ebook/dp/B07M87BWRC))

**Please note that the above book by Epp is much better suited for beginners, whereas MIT Math for CS is much more difficult.** (Solutions to that one are [here](https://github.com/spamegg1/Epp-Discrete-Math-5th-solutions).)
